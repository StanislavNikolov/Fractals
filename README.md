There is a small agent on the canvas that you give instructions. They *currently* are limited to:  
u - go 10 pixels up  
d - go 10 pixels down  
l - go 10 pixels left  
r - go 10 pixels right
s - spawn a new turtle from the current position with the current color. He (the turtle) has the same instructions.  
c{n1,n2,n3} - change the trace color to rgb(n1,n2,n3)

Example: drurrC{100,100,100}sddd
