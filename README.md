There is a small agent on the canvas that you give instructions. They *currently* are limited to:
u - go 10 pixels up
d - go 10 pixels down
l - go 10 pixels left
r - go 10 pixels right
s - spawn a new turtle from the current position with the current color. He (the turtle) has the same instructions.
C{r,g,b} - change the trace color to rgb(r,g,b);

Example: drurrC{100,100,100}sddd
